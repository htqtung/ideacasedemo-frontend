This assignment is like a review for what I learned in Front-End Development course.

I did learn something new such as the reason to use .jsx instead of .js, how the files should be organized and also how to use pure JavaScript alongside with React. In previous courses I only used either pure JavaScript or pure React and did not combine them in any way so this is new for me.
